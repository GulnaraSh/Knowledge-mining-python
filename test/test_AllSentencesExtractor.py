             evaluation, authorization and restriction of chemicals (REACH) to
             protect human health and the environment from hazards of
             industrial chemicals. Industry has to register all substances
             produced in or imported into the EU at rate >1 t/y.
             Physicochemical, (eco) toxicological and exposure-relevant
             information have to be supplied for registration depending on
             the production rate. For environmental assessment of chemicals
             to be registered by 2018 (1e100 t/y) at least the following
             information has to be presented: - Acute toxicity to algae,
             daphniand fish (the latter only for substances.>10 t/y)
             -Octanol/water partition coefficient (log KOW)
             - Water solubility (SW)
             - Biodegradability
             This information is used to decide whether substance has to be
             classified as hazardous to the aquatic environment and labelled
             according to the CLP regulation (European Commission, 2009).
             For substances �10 t/y chemical safety assessment (CSA) has to
             be performed, including the derivation of the predicted
             environmental concentration (PEC) as well as the predicted no
             effect concentration (PNEC) and the assessment of (very)
             persistent, (very) bioaccumulative and
             toxic (PBT/vPvB) properties."""
